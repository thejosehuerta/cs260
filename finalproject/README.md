#### CS 260 - Final Project: Graph
---
For our final project, our duty was to complete three main tasks:
1.  Create some tests before you start coding.
2.  Implement a graph class with at least:
    * a function to add a new vertex to the graph (perhaps add_vertex(vertex_name))
    * a function to add a new edge between two vertices of the graph (perhaps add_edge(source, destination) or source.add_edge(destination))
    * a function for a shortest path algorithm (perhaps shortest_path(source, destination))
    * a function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example min_span_tree()).
3.  Analyze the complexity of all of your graph behaviors.
