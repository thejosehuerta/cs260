Assignment 1

In this program, our goal is to model a bag of marbles with the ability to add a marble, remove a marble and verify that the program is working.

1.  Properties and behaviours:

    a.  There will be threee different colors of marbles to choose from: black, white, and yellow. They will be represented as ints.
        There will be no capacity to this bag.
        
    b.  In order to add a new marbel, a series of switch statements are used to ask the user what color of marble they wish to add,
        and how many.
        
    c.  In order to remove a marble, another switch statement is used to ask the user what color they wish to remove. The program makes sure
        the color of marble exists before removing them.
        
    d.  in order to show that the program is working correctly, a switch statement case that shows the current contents of the bag is implemented.
        There is a while loop in the program, so the user can add or remove marbles as they please without having to re-run the program.
