#### 1.  Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:
    a.  What functions are we likely to need for a queue?
    testing
    
    b.  What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?

#### 2.  Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):
    a.  What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?
    testing
    
    b.  What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?
