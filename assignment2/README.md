#### 1.  Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:
    a.  What functions are we likely to need for a queue?
    
        Similar to a stack, we would need a peek function (gets the front element without removing it), an 
        isfull function (checks to see if the queue is full), and an isempty function (checks to see if the queue is empty). 
        Furthermore, we would also need an enqueue function that adds an item to the queue, and a dequeue function that 
        removes an item from the queue.
    
    b.  What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?
    
        A queue data structure is open at both ends where one end is always used to insert data, and the 
        other is used to remove data. Much like the example of a one-way road:

#### 2.  Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):
    a.  What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?

    b.  What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?
